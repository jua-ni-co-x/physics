# Rod and Cylinder  
2D dynamics simulation of a rod placed on a cylinder, with their symmetry axis transversal to one another. The first two assumptions are: rolling condition and no friction.  
For the simu, perturbation regime is studied, therefore, the rod is found to oscillate around the equilibrium point (top of the cylinder). Code output is a video with such
phenomenon.
