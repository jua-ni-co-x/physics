# 2D Ising Model
### _Authors: Cox, J.N., Lopez Gil, F., Schluz Alcetegaray, M._

This project was an assignment for the course Física Teórica 3 (Statistical Mechanics) dictated in the first semester of 2024 at the
University of Buenos Aires (Argentina). The objective was to simulate the ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition of a 2D spin system.
The code is self-explained (in Spanish): covers some theoretical aspects and observations are made about the simulation results. An English version is on the way.
