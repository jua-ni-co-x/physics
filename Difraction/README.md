# Diffraction pattern of horizontally even-spaced circular slits  
Just as the title says, the code generates the screen pattern of horizontally even-spaced circular slits by summing the electric field contribution of each point on the slit.   Vertical white lines in the center of constructive interference regions come from `division by zero` or `inf` in code, not to be interpreted as part of the pattern.
